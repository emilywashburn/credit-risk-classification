## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* Explain the purpose of the analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the precision of the data model that forecasts the creditworthyness of borrowers in a peer to peer lending. 

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
Precision: For low risk loans the model was 100% accurate. The model was only 87% accurate in predicting high-risk loans.
Accuracy: 94%
Recall: For low risk loans the model had 100% recall. The model only had 89% recall for high-risk loans.


* Machine Learning Model 2:
Precision: For lowrisk loans the model was 100% accurate. The model was only 87% accurate in predicting high-risk loans.
Accuracy: 100%
Recall: 100%


## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.

I would recommend model 2 as the accuracy and recall was 100%
